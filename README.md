My dotfiles for linux & more

## ZSH:
- .zshrc
- .aliases

Optional: add custom directory hashes to `$ZSH/custom/dirs.zsh` in the syntax of i.e. `hash -d winHome=/mnt/c/Users/name`
Optional: to get the theme running you may need to install [cascadia code pl](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases) at least under windows terminal
